This project focuses on finding the optimal day to book a particular flight for which the flight ticket cost will be minimum before the departure date. For this purpose, we have shortlisted a set of characteristic features that are suspected to affect the price of flight tickets. The features are applied to various machine learning algorithms to predict the flight ticket cost. Performance of the various models was compared with each other. The data was collected from flight results at MakeMyTrip.com for top 7 domestic routes in India. The experiments showed that with the various model trained we are able to save an average of INR 2042 per flight.
